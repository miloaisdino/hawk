Bewit
------

Hawk supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual
resources using a query parameter called bewit. This can be used for granting access
to protected resources such as images or videos to an user.

### Client

The return value is a string that represents the bewit. This string should be
added to a requested URI by appending it to the end of the URI. If the URI has
query paramters already, the bewit should have `&bewit=` appended to the front
of it. If the URI does not have query paramters already, the bewit should
have `?bewit=` appended to the front of it.

#### Client Bewit Example

```php
<?php

$bewit = $client->createBewit(
    $credentials,
    'https://example.com/posts?foo=bar',
    300 // ttl in seconds
);
```

### Server

Bewit authentication should only occur for `GET` and `HEAD` requests. The return
value of an authenticated bewit is a Server Response object.

#### Server Bewit Example

```php
<?php

$response = $server->authenticateBewit(
    'example.com',
    443,
    '/posts?bewit=ZXhxYlpXdHlrRlpJaDJEN2NYaTlkQVwxMzY4OTk2ODAwXE8wbWhwcmdvWHFGNDhEbHc1RldBV3ZWUUlwZ0dZc3FzWDc2dHBvNkt5cUk9XA'
    // This above bewit=<bewit> parameter is generated by the client in the previous example
);
```
